# Frontend Challege: Movies list

Create a SPA (single page web application) that shows a listing of movies.
The dataset js provided as a JSON file containing data of American movies from 1980 to 2000, scraped from Wikipedia.

[JSON dataset](movies.1980-2000.json)

## Base Features

The app will have two pages:

- Movies listing: with year, title and thumbnail for each listed movies
- Movie detail: with all the information available for the movie

## Bonus features

- Add a search interface in the listing page (test search or filters, ex by year)
- Allow the user to save locally some movies as "favorite" and provide a page to list favorite movies. The data should be persisted using local storage API or similar strategies


## Technology

One of the following javascript frameworks/libraries should be used for the implementation:

- React
- Vue
- Angular
